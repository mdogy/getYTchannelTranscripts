The captions are often not available. Google does generate auto captions and these can be downloaded by 
yt-dlp but can not be captured. When captions are not available the captions should be downloaded automatically
as a .vtt file. The script should wait for this download keeping track of whether it is a success or not. Then it
should parse the .vtt file and print or save the transcript.
