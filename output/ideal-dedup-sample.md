I think there's going to be thousands of mobile apps built with AI but also have AI that are going to be a million dollar a year businesses. And I found uh a founder called Sherry Jen and she vibe coded this app uh built it built it in public got thousands of customers to it and I think she's a first-time founder. So I'm trying something new. I brought her on the podcast and I said, "Hey, what can you teach us about how you built in public, how you vibe coded this thing, um, and just your your thought process for for building this company."
